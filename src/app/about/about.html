        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Bilingual full-stack developer (English/Spanish) and technical instructor passionate about building scalable, impactful applications—and helping others grow along the way.
            With hands-on experience in Python, Java, Angular, and PostgreSQL, I bring a rare blend of backend engineering, teaching, and mentorship rooted in a philosophy background 
            and sharpened through industry projects. I thrive in Agile environments where communication, clean code, and curiosity drive better solutions. Currently deepening my CS 
            foundations at Toronto Metropolitan University (Expected 2025).
